![cover](https://github.com/mertfozzy/Image-Compressor-for-Linux/blob/main/protoype.png?raw=true)

This project is basically compress multiple or single images at once. Can be using both Linux based operating systems and MS Windows.

For building, I used Python programming language and Pyqt5 library for GUI side. Also, PIL library used for compressing operations. Design can be edit with using QSS (it is like CSS, not so hard to read.)

This project can be use in SEO jobs, photo backups or free upping storage.
